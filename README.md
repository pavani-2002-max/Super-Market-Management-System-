# Super-Market-Management-System-
In this project, we will develop a Supermarket Management System designed as a three-tier application.  

Front end: UI is written in HTML/CSS/Javascript/Bootstrap Backend: Python and Flask Database: mysql

The Grocery Management System we developed is functional. However, after releasing it to users, we received the following feedback. Your task is to address this feedback and implement the suggested features in the application.

1.**Products Module**: In products page that lists current products.

2.**Orders Module**: When you place an order it doesn't have any validation. For example one can enter an order with empty customer name. You need to add validation for customer name and invalid item name or not specifying a quantity etc. This is only front end UI work.

3.**Orders Module**: In new order page there is a bug. When you manually change total price of an item it doesn't change the grand total. You need to fix this issue.

4.**Orders Module**: In the grid where orders are listed, add a view button in the last column. On clicking this button it should show you order details where individual items in that order are listed along with their price/quantity etc.
